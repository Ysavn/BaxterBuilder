Level of table: -0.245 in z
"just a little short of the right edge" is at y = -0.477
That's about the limit of where a block would fit, so I think that's a good margin, actually
The board is 32 in across, so 84.5 cm, so I expect the opposite side to be at about 0.37
"just a little short of the back edge" (6.6 cm short) is at x=0.809, and it's 54.6 cm deep
So I think the back edge is at 0.87 and the front is at 0.32
This is with the whiteboard lined up flush with the "positive y" side of the table, flush with the edge closest to Baxter

So, table specs (in m, in Baxter's coordinate frame)
0.32 < x < 0.87
-0.48 < y < 0.37
z = -0.245

Ready position:
xyz = [0.55 -0.55 -0.05]

Camera position:
xyz = [0.64 0.00 0.54]

Blocks are an inch on a side, so 0.00254 m
We'll want to direct the gripper to grab 0.00127 above the table surface, which is -0.245
So the "grab height" should be -0.24373

Farthest extentions at table level:
Maximum rotation:
Can reach the positive y near corner of the board xy = [0.32 0.37]
Intermediate rotation:
Can reach xy = [0.784 0.05]
Zero rotation:
When reaching straight forward from the shoulder, can reach xy = [0.840 -0.397]
Negative rotation:
When reaching slightly farther in the negative y direction, can reach xy = [0.75 -0.63]

So, it can reach the near-positive-y corner and the far-negative y corner, but
